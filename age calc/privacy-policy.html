        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to AgeCalc! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle the minimal information we collect when you use our app. It also includes details about our refund policy related to the lifetime purchase for removing ads.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We do not collect or store any personally identifiable information such as your name, email, or mobile number. The app operates without user registration or login.</p>
        
        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not collect or use personal information for any purposes. AgeCalc only processes data entered by the user (like birth dates) to calculate results such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Age Comparisons</li>
            <li>Half Birthday Countdown</li>
            <li>Retirement Age Calculation</li>
            <li>Other related calculations</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. In-App Purchase and Ads</h2>
        <p>Lifetime Purchase to Remove Ads: AgeCalc offers a one-time, lifetime purchase option that allows users to remove advertisements within the app. No payment information is collected or stored by AgeCalc directly. All transactions are processed securely via the app store (e.g., Google Play or Apple App Store). The app does not have recurring subscriptions, logins, or account registration.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>While refunds are generally not applicable for in-app purchases (such as removing ads), we may offer refunds in specific situations:</p>
        <p><strong>Technical Issues:</strong> If technical problems significantly prevent you from using the app as intended after the lifetime purchase.</p>
        <p><strong>How to Request a Refund:</strong></p>
        <p>Contact Us: Email us at <strong>feedback@xvantageinfotech.com</strong> with the subject line “Refund Request” and provide the details of your purchase and the issue you encountered.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect or store any personal information, we do not share, sell, or rent any data to third parties. The only data processed in the app are birth dates or other inputs you provide for calculation purposes, and this data is not shared or transmitted.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Although we do not store or transmit personal data, we have implemented security measures to protect the app from unauthorized access or vulnerabilities. However, no digital system can be 100% secure.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect personal information, there is no user data that needs to be removed or inquired about. If you have any concerns about the data you enter into the app, you can contact us.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the updated policy in the app. Please review this policy periodically to stay informed.</p>
